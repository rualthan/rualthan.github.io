[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) is an open source automation software. It automates the various phases of software development.
- Build
- Test
- Deployment/Delivery

## CI/CD
### Continuous Integration (CI)
- CI is the practice of frequently integrating code from multiple developers. 
- Every commit or push to a central repository triggers automated build and test.
- Build/Test failure triggers an alert to developers.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
- A practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. 
- Requires manual approval before deployment.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- A practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. 

## Install Jenkins
1. Jenkins can be deployed as [container or java](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) WAR but I will install it using the old fashioned way on Ubuntu 22.04. I follow the [instructions](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu) on Jenkins website. 

1. Jenkins has two releases - Weekly release and LTS release. I will use the LTS release.

1. It requires Java. I will install Java 21 which is compatible with the latest LTS (2.479.1 October 2024) at the time of writing this.

1. Install Java
    ```
    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-21-jre -y
    ```

    Verify
    ```
    java -version
    openjdk version "21.0.8" 2025-07-15
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.8+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu122.04.1)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.8+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu122.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)
    ```

1. Add Jenkins repository
    ```
    sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt update -y
    ```
1. Install Jenkins
    ```
    sudo apt install jenkins -y
    ```

    Enable and start Jenkins
    ```
    sudo systemctl --now jenkins
    ```

    Verify
    ```
    sudo systemctl status jenkins
    ```

    Jenkins should ve available at http://localhost:8080. 

    To change the default port 8080 to some other port, edit the following file and restart Jenkins
    ```
    grep 8080   /usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service
    Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8080"
    ```
    The Jenkins config file and parameter to edit may change. 
1. Get the admin password from `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
1. Go to http://locahost:8080
1. Follow the on screen steps
1. Jenkins is ready

## First Job
1. Go to Jenkins
1. New Item
1. Provide a name
1. Freestyle project
1. Build Steps
    1. Execute shell
    1. Enter Command: echo "My first Jenkins job"
1. Save
1. Build Now
1. Go to Console Output to see the output

## Trigger build from GitHub 
We can trigger Jenkins build from GitHub using Webhook. In this section, we will do the following:
1. Configure GitHub and Jenkins integration using webhook
1. Make change from GitHub

Configure the integration
1. In Jenkins > Manage Jenkins (the gear icon) > System > GitHub > Advance > Override Hook URL
1. Jenkins runs on my local host. GitHubs won't be able to access it. To expose Jenkins to the internet, I use ngrok.
1. Get ngrok url for Jenkins
    ```
    ngrok http 8080
    ```
    Copy the ngrok URL `https://example.ngrok-free.app`
1. Go to your GitHub repository > Settings > Webhooks
1. In Payload URL, paste the ngrok url and append github-webook, don't miss the trailing slash: `https://example.ngrok-free.app/github-webhook/`
1. Add webhook

Create a Jenkins Job
1. New Item > Enter a name > Freestyle project > OK
1. Source Code Management > Git
1. Enter the repository htts url under Repository URL
1. Branches to build > main
1. Triggers > GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
1. Save
1. To test > Build Now

Trigger build from GitHub
1. Go to the GitHub repository 
1. Edit some file and commit
1. This should trigger a build. In Jenkins, if you don't see a new build, refresh the page.
1. Click on the build, you should see "Started by GitHub push by user_name".

This is Continuous Integration.

We made a commit from GitHub GUI. Let us know commit with git CLI

1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone URL
    ```
1. cd <DIR>
1. Make some change
1. git add . && git commit -m "message"
1. In Jenkins > Go to the job
1. There should be a new build
1. Open the build. Inspect the status, changes and Console Output.


Modern IDEs such as VS Code has integrations with git/GitHub.We can commit and push changes from VS Code itself.

1. Open the repository in VS Code
2. Make some changes
2. Go the Source Control
2. Enter a commit message and click Commit
2. To push to remote, click Sync Changes
2. In Jenkins, go to the job and inspect the latest build.

## Deploy Java App to Tomcat
We will do a one click deployment of  Java App to Tomcat. We will need maven to build the java App as well. The Vagrant file I use for this setup is available here: [cicd-jenkins-tomcat](https://github.com/rualthan/vagrantfiles/tree/main/cicd-jenkins-tomcat). 



1. We first need to find the install directory of Maven and Java. 
    ```
    which mvn
    /opt/maven/bin/mvn

    readlink -f $(which java)
    /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-arm64/bin/java
    ```
    These are the paths to the binaries. The install directory will be `/opt/maven` and `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-arm64/`.

1. Since we want Jenkins to build Java code, it has to know where java and maven are installed. 
   In Jenkins > Go to Manage Jenins > Tools
    - Java installations > Add JDK
    - Name: Java
    - JAVA_HOME:/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-arm64/ 
    - Maven Installations > Add Maven
    - Name: Maven
    - MAVEN_HOME:/opt/maven/

1. In Jenkins, install the plugin Deploy to Container. We need this to deploy a  WAR file to Tomcat.
1. In GitHub, fork this https://github.com/PythonAwsBoto3/webapp

We are ready to create a job in Jenkins.
1. New Item > Provide a Name > Freestyle Project
1. Source Code Management > Git > Provide the repository URL
1. Build Steps > Add build step > Invoke top-level Maven targets > Select Maven
1. Post-build Actions > Add post-build action > Deploy war/ear to a container 
    - WAR/EAR files:**/*.war
    - Containers > Add Container > Tomcat 9x
    - Add the Tomcat credentials
    - Add Tomcat URL. For me, it is http://localhost:8090
1. Build Now

If the build is successful.

- Go to Tomcat
- Manager App
- Click on /mvn-hello-world
- Your App is deployed

Lets change the job automatically trigger a new build when there's change in the source code.

1. Open the job in Jenkins > Configure > Triggers > Poll SCM
1. It uses cron syntax for schedule. For our example, I will use "* * * * *" for Jenkins to check the repository every minute.
1. In the repository, open webapp/src/main/webapp/index.jsp
1. Make some change
1. This should trigger the job in the next 1 minute in Jenkins.
1. Once the job ran, check the outcome in <tomcat_url>/mvn-hello-world.
