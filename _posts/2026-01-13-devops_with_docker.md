title: DevOps with Docker
---

[DevOps with Docker](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-docker) is an online course by the University of Helsinki. Until now, I haven't heard of it but it seems the online courses from this University are well known. Check out the other [courses](https://www.mooc.fi/en/). My notes and exercise solutions are available [here](https://github.com/rualthan/devops_with_docker/tree/main).

About this course:
- There are 4 chapters and 16 exercises.
- The exercises are centered around containerizing applications which I feel is the USP of this course. 
- It starts with a brief introduction of DevOps, server virtualization and how VMs are not efficient since it requires a full OS.
- It is followed by an introduction to containers and Docker.
- After running through basic commands, it moves to building an image.
- Chapter 3 introduces Docker Compose to encapsulate complex docker run commands and to run multiple containers.
- The exercises include a tiered architecture where a proxy is placed in front of apps and database.
- Without a background in fullstack development, the exercises can fell daunting but there's nothing you can't solve with a thorough reading of the instruction and a some Googling, may be LLMs.
- The course concludes with methods to optimize image for performance and security.
- On completion of the course, you get a certificate as well as [ECTS](https://education.ec.europa.eu/education-levels/higher-education/inclusive-and-connected-higher-education/european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system) credits

Is it for beginners?
It could be on the challenging side for the absolute beginner. As a long time admin and support Engineer with experience in Linux, Virtualization and having dabbled in Docker before, I found the course very enjoyable. 

I recommend it.
