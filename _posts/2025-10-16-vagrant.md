Vagrant is a tool for managing the lifecycle of a VM- create, destroy and other things in between. It use to quickly spin up temporary VMs on a local machine. It was written by Mitchell HashiCorp, the founder of HashiCorp, in 2010, two year before HashiCorp. It works with most virtualization softwares such as VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V etc.

## Why Vagrant
Instead of spending time manually creating a VM and installing the OS which will take a few dozen minutes, how about running a few simple commands to get our VM ready? Using an [image](https://www.osboxes.org/virtualbox-images/) instead of installing it from ISO will save you something but Vagrant will be still be much faster. 

Watch how simple it is to get an Ubuntu 24.04 VM.
```
vagrant init bento/ubuntu-22.04 --box-version 202508.03.0
vagrant up
```

Just to commands and my VM is ready. 
```
vagrant ssh
vagrant@vagrant:~$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
Release:	22.04
Codename:	jammy
vagrant@vagrant:~$
```
## Setup
Install Vagrant and the virtualization provider of your choice. I use VirtualBox. 
```
VBoxManage --version
7.1.10r169112

vagrant -v
Vagrant 2.4.7
```
Check the Vagrant documentation for the compatibility between Vagrant and Vbox versions.

## Spin up VM
Lets spin up a VM the Vagrant way and look at the steps in detail.

1. Find the template, hereafter box, of your choice from [Vagrant Public Registry](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover?query=). We will use [bento/ubuntu-22.04](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover/bento/ubuntu-22.04). 

2. Create new directory and go there
    ```
    mkdir ubuntu
    cd ubuntu/
    ```
   Each VM should be in their own the directory.

3. Using the instructions on the right, run:
    ```
    vagrant init bento/ubuntu-22.04 --box-version 202508.03.0
    ```
    This download the Vagrantfile which is the Vagrant configuration for project. A project can have one or multiple VMs. We will come back to this.
4. Bring up the VM.
    ```
    vagrant up
    ```
    As this is the first time, it will download the image from the registry and starts it. If there are no errors, your VM is ready.
5. Get into the VM
    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```
    The box ships with the public key of vagrant and the vagrant software has the private key. This enables password-less SSH to the VM. 

6. What's in the Vagrantfile?
    You will that it is full of comments explain what each part does. If you remove the comments, there are 4 lines only.
    ```
    grep -v  # Vagrantfile | grep -v ^$
    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
        config.vm.box_version = "202508.03.0"
    end
    ```
    The box_version is optional. It used to note which version of the box is used as they are regular updated. 

    If we run the vagrant init command with `--box-version 202508.03.0`, there will be just three uncommented lines, out of which the name of box (config.vm.box) is the only actual parameter. 
    ```
    grep -v  # Vagrantfile | grep -v ^$
    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
    end
    ```
    The rest are defaults.

## Most used commands
You need to inside the directory of a box to run these commands.
1. Download a Vagrant box
    ```
    vagrant init box_name
    ```
1. Start your box
    ```
    vagrant up
    ```
1. Find the status
    ```
    vagrant status
    ```
1. SSH to your box
    ```
    vagrant ssh
    ```
1. Shutdown your box
    ```
    vagrant halt
    ```
1. Delete your box
    ```
    vagrant destroy
    ```

## Access guest service from outside
I can't speak for other providers. with VBox, Vagrant creates a NAT network. It can go out but we cannot go it directly. There are two ways to reach services running in the box
1. Port Forward
   There is an httpd service in the box listening on port 80. To access it from the host on port 8080, add the followingto the Vagrantfile and restart it.
   ```
   config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
   ```

   ```
   cat Vagrantfile
    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
        config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
    end
    ```
2. Host-only Network
    - In VBox, create a Host-only network vagrantnet-vbox1.
    - Add to Vagrantfile
        ```
        config.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp", name: "vagrantnet-vbox1"
        ```
        It should look like:
        ```
        cat Vagrantfile
        Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
            config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
            config.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp", name: "vagrantnet-vbox1"
        end
        ```
    - Restart
    - SSH into the box and find IP attached to the Host-only network
    - Use the IP to access the service from the host
    - You can identify the IP based on the range. To find the Host-only network range, run `VBoxManage list hostonlynets`. Or check it from the Network section in the VBox GUI.

## Dual box setup
If you need two boxes to be managed in a single Vagrant file:
```
cat Vagrantfile
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Define first VM
  config.vm.define "ubuntu1" do |ubuntu1|
    ubuntu1.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
    ubuntu1.vm.hostname = "ubuntu1"
  end

  # Define second VM
  config.vm.define "ubuntu2" do |ubuntu2|
    ubuntu2.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
    ubuntu2.vm.hostname = "ubuntu2"
  end
end
```

They are identified by the hostnames.
```
vagrant status
Current machine states:

ubuntu1                   running (virtualbox)
ubuntu2                   running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
```

To operate on a box:
```
vagrant <command> <name>
```

Example:
```
vagrant status ubuntu1
```
```
vagrant ssh ubuntu1
```


## Provisioner
You can install packages and configure the OS using the provisioner. To install Apache httpd, enable and start the service:
```
cat Vagrantfile
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  sudo apt update -y
  sudo apt install apache2 -y
  sudo systemctl enable apache2
  sudo systemctl start apache2
  SHELL
end
```

Note that I am forwarding the port too. Once the box comes up, the web service can be access from the host at `http://localhost:8080`.

The provision block is executed the first time you run `vagrant up` and any time you run `vagrant provision`.
