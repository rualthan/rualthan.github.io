# TLDR

Git is a type of SCM(Source Code Managed), specifically a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System).

It was written by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

Check git is installed, install it otherwise
git --version or git -v

Two days to create a repository:
Convert a local dir into a git repository
Clone an existing repository from somewhere

A file in a git repository can be in three states:
modified: A new file or an existing file that has been changed
staged:  The modifiled file has been selected (staged) for commit
committed: The staged file(s) are not in the local repository

There are three areas of git project:
Working Directory
Staging Area (aka Index, .git/index)
Local repository (.git/object)

Git config
Do this on a new system before git init or git clone.

git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
git config --global core.editor emacs
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --list

.gitignore
Create this file in our repository. 
Add a list of files and directory you want git to ignore.

Git basic workflow
vi filename
git add filename
git commit -m "add filename"
push to remote 

Check the status of files in the repository
git status

Check git history
git log
git log --oneline

Check current branch
git branch

Create new branch
git branch branch_name

Switch to different branch
git checkout branch_name
git switch branch

Create new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b branch_name
git switch -c branch_name

Merge a branch to main
git checkout -b feature
make changes
stage and commit
git checkout main
git merge feature

Clone a repository
git clone URL

This creates the directory, initilizes it and files in the repository are checked out to the working dir 

Pair an existing local repository with remote and push it
git remote add origin URL
git push -u origin main

Diff between commit
git diff 9686bb8 e6de8d6

Diff between branch
git diff master..footer
